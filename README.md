# ANLY511-Project_Report_Codes

Understanding music and track popularity is important not only for the artists who create and perform music but also for the audience. 
This project is to help the reader to understand musicâ€™s popularity by making analysis on different factors such as time, genre, and artists. 
The team first defines the important factors that could have impacts on the popularity of the music based on different related works, 
to cover multiple aspects of popularity. Then, the analysis of each factor is conducted with real-world recorded and text data to 
deeply understand the characteristics of music popularity and determine the factors that contribute to the popularity of the music. 
The team utilizes different methods throughout the analysis such as exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression models for 
defining the factors that affect popularity. In particular, the team focuses on the relatively crucial features of the music such as genres, time, and 
artists through modeling and testing. The results show that certain genres are indeed more popular than others. In addition, energy, loudness, instrumentalness, and 
tempo of a song are also factors that can contribute to the popularity. The team also concludes that besides these factors found by the team, 
there could be other potential factors such as audience opinions, different country, and even society can have impacts on the people's likes of the music. 
Therefore, future analysis on more factors with more data will be conducted utilizing different models to understand the music popularity more thoroughly.
